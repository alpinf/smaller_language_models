# Smaller Language Models

A collection of notebooks for reducing language models size.

## Setup

At this point, we only tested the setup of the notebooks in Google Colab.

Each notebook has an "Open in Colab" button and the list of dependencies to install.

This repo includes some of the results of **Luca Barriviera**'s internship at Alpinference.
